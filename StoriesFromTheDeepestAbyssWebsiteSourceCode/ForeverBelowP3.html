    <p>They say the deeper you go into the dungeon, the weirder it gets. Monsters and strange creatures roam around. Some people say they have seen things that doesn't make any sense! But they've also found all sorts of things that helps people.
        <br><br>
        And they say that the only way out, is to go deeper into the dungeon. They say that the deeper you go, the closer you get to the abyss..
        <br><br>
        The rumors say that something big is happening from down below. 
        No one knows what it is, but monsters from the lower levels have started to come up to the upper levels. <br>
        People are getting scared. <br>
