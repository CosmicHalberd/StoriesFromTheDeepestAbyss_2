    <h1>Forever Below</h1>
    Adventurers used to go in and out of the dungeon all the time. Most of them only ever stayed in the upper floors, because the deeper ones were too scary. 
        Mommy and daddy always said that bad people get banished down there and never come back… 
        But then the dungeon started acting weird and the entrance closed. Now there's only a portal that lets people go in, but no way to come back out.
        <br><br>
        And after the old king got murdered, the new king started sending people he didn't like.
        He doesn't care if they did something bad or not. He just sends them away. Like mommy and daddy…
        <br><br>
        He would send people that don't like him or doesn't follow his rules. People like mommy and daddy. So many people have been sent to the dungeon. People built homes and such in the first level of the dungeon, hoping one day they can return back to the land above.
