    <h1>Forever Below</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Ava. My daddy says I should leave notes behind incase I turn up missing. Right now me and my little sis are resting near a creek near the Hermit's 
        dwelling. It's been a month since we left home to find our mom and dad. So me and my sis decided to go look for them since nobody wanted to look for them.
        <br><br>
        We heard from a group of adventurers that they saw someone that looked like our mom near the pathway that leads deeper into the dungeon. They said she was with a group of people that looked like adventurers. 
        Daddy went to look for mommy a week ago but he hasn't come back yet. I think he might have gone deeper into the dungeon to look for her.
        <br><br>
        I don't know what to do. I'm scared but I have to be brave for my little sis. I hope we find mommy and daddy soon. If only the king didn't banish us..
